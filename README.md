## Live

[You can find the live version](https://blog-app-nextjs.netlify.app/) of the Blog application I made using Next.js and bootstrap here.

## Setup

``` bash
npm install
```

## Run the project

First, run the development server:

``` bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
